Automated Pothole Detection using YOLO
Introduction:

Potholes are a major safety hazard on roads. They can cause damage to vehicles, lead to accidents, and even injure or kill people. The best way to improve road maintenance efficiency is by detecting and reporting potholes in real-time using an AI-based detection like YOLO. YOLO is an AI framework used to perform detection, segmentation, track the item, classification, and pose detection. In this project Yolov8n.pt, a pretrained model of 80 objects is used for pothole detection.

Objective:

The goal of this project is to create an AI-based pothole detection model capable of automatic detection and identification of potholes using YOLO.

Significance:

Automated pothole detection model helps to reduce vehicle maintenance costs and the risk of accidents. This method is cost effective compared to traditional methods like manual inspection and visual surveys of roads.

Applications:

Fixed Cameras: Fixed cameras can be installed at strategic locations along roads to monitor for potholes. These cameras can send alerts to road crews when potholes are detected.

Mobile Cameras: Mobile cameras can be mounted on vehicles or drones to survey roads for potholes. These cameras can collect data that can be used to create a map of potholes in a particular area.

In-vehicle Sensors: In-vehicle sensors can be used to detect potholes as vehicles are driving. These sensors can send alerts to drivers when potholes are detected.
